In this project, I have practiced my Cypress testing skills by tackling various scenarios on [the-internet](http://the-internet.herokuapp.com/) web application. From form handling to authentication and dynamic content, this platform has been a valuable testing ground and has given me hands-on experience and confidence to tackle real-world web application challenges effectively.
