## Projects

In this section, I have linked some projects I have worked on using test automation tools.

### Project 1 - Cypress

[**Project Link**](https://github.com/Bertinaoz/testing-the-internet-cypress)

In this project, I have practiced my Cypress testing skills by tackling various scenarios on [the-internet](http://the-internet.herokuapp.com/) web application. From form handling to authentication and dynamic content, this platform has been a valuable testing ground and has given me hands-on experience and confidence to tackle real-world web application challenges effectively.

### Project 2 - Playwright

[**Project Link**](https://github.com/Bertinaoz/testing-saucedemo-playwright)

In this project, I have practiced my Playwright testing skills on the [sauce demo](https://www.saucedemo.com/) e-commerce web application. The testing includes logging in with valid and invalid credentials, adding and removing items from the cart and checking out.
